# Ideas board

This simple app allows the user create, update and delete ideas. There is no API, however the code has been written in a way so it could be adapted to work with an API without much effort.

There are a few simple integration tests.

It's been written in TypeScript, however this is my first TypeScript project, so I'm fairly sure it's far from perfect.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies via `yarn install` or `npm install`
1. To run locally, use `yarn start` or `npm start`
1. To run the tests use `yarn test` or `npm test`
