# Memo / Ideas board

This app allows the user create, update and delete ideas. There is no API, however the code has been designed in a way so it could be adapted to work with an API with minimal effort.

There are a few integration tests. These can be found in `src/App.test.tsx`

## Installation

1. Install dependencies via `yarn` or `npm install`
1. To run locally, use `yarn start` or `npm start`
1. To run the tests use `yarn test` or `npm test`
